# CyberFusion  

**CyberFusion** is a hybrid ransomware detection framework designed for **small businesses**.  
It combines fast **static screening** with selective **dynamic analysis**, achieving both **efficiency** and **high accuracy** in detecting ransomware threats.

---

## Data Policy  

**Do not commit raw samples.**  
Only include metadata or synthetic examples in the `data/` directory.

---

## Results (Summary)  

- **Static RF Trigger**:  
  ~99.97% accuracy on **benign vs malicious** classification (with high recall)

- **Hybrid Fusion Model**:  
  ~99.5% overall accuracy with **strong calibration**

---

## Disclaimer  

This project is intended for **research and educational purposes only**.  
**Never run unknown binaries** outside of a secure and isolated environment.

---

## Architecture  

- **Stage 1**: Static PE metadata â†’ **Random Forest** trigger â†’ _benign or suspicious_  
- **Stage 2**: Sandbox API calls â†’ **BiLSTM** classifier for ransomware behavior  
- **Optional Fusion**: Static features + dynamic sequence embedding â†’ **CNN + BiLSTM head**
